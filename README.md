# Pandunet_Web

This repository contains the project paper “PanduNet: Pedestrian Detection Accurate Network with Deformable Units”, which proposes a lightweight pedestrian detector based on SSD + MobileNet augmented with modulated deformable convolution layers.

# Summary

* Base model: Single Shot Detector (SSD) with MobileNet backbone 
* Key idea: Improve robustness to pose, orientation, and geometric variation using Deformable Convolution Units.
* Additional module: A lightweight pedestrian tracking approach using bounding boxes + temporal aggregation.
